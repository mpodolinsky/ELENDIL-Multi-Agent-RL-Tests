Possible agents:
- SB3 using wrappers (would most likely work best with Petting Zoo where the wrappers are from).
- MARL-book: https://github.com/marl-book/codebase
- HARL: https://github.com/PKU-MARL/HARL - Heterogeneous agents. Maybe there could be some improvements here especially when dealing with actual POMDP (this paper theoretically assumed MDP).
